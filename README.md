✅ **Handles Multiple Branches** – Easily create MRs for multiple target branches without hassle. 

✅ **Reduces Repetitive Tasks** – Automate filling in details with take your last commit as PR description.  

✅ **Boosts Productivity** – Spend less time managing MRs and more time coding.

✅ **Duplicate PR Prevention:** – Checks for existing PRs before creating a new one.

✅ **Error Handling & Logging:** – Stay informed with detailed logs.

✅ **Custom Target Branches** – Specify branches manually for future use or set different target branches each time, even exporting your daily ones for flexible PR creation.

## 🛠️ How to Get Started

###  **1️⃣ Install the Script**

Run the following command to install and make it system-wide:

```bash

sudo curl -sSLo /usr/local/bin/gitlab_pr https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theizekry/gitlab-merge-requests-bot/main/gitlab_pr.sh && sudo chmod  +x  /usr/local/bin/gitlab_pr

```

###  **2️⃣ Set Up Your GitLab Token**

To authenticate with GitLab, you need a either **Personal Access Token** or **Project Access Token**:

A **Personal Access Token** is linked to your user account for broad access across projects for more info please visit https://shorturl.at/QEbyn., while a **Project Access Token** is limited to a specific project.  
Set your token as `GITLAB_TOKEN` in your environment for authentication.  

**To authenticate with GitLab, you need either a **Personal Access Token** (linked to your user account for broad access across projects) or a **Project Access Token** (limited to specific project repositories for enhanced security).  
For both, the required scopes are **API** and **write_repository**.  


_Note:_ A project token only works with repos granted to it, whereas a personal token can access all projects on your GitLab account; set your token as `GITLAB_TOKEN` in your environment.**

THEN

```bash

echo  'export GITLAB_TOKEN="your_generated_token_here"'  >>  ~/.bashrc

source  ~/.bashrc

```

For **Zsh users**:

```bash

echo  'export GITLAB_TOKEN="your_generated_token_here"'  >>  ~/.zshrc

source  ~/.zshrc

```

## 🚀 Usage

###  ✅  **Create Merge Requests for Default Target Branches (`develop`, `master`, `uat`)**

```bash

gitlab_pr

```









  

### ✅  **Specify Target Branches Manually**

```bash

gitlab_pr  staging  production

```

*(Creates MRs for `staging` and `production`.)*

  

### ✅ **Override Default Target Branches**

By default, the script creates merge requests for the following branches: `develop`, `master`, and `uat`. If you need to change this behavior, you can override the default target branches by exporting your own:

```bash

export  DEFAULT_TARGET_BRANCHES="branch1 branch2 branch3"

```

  

### ✅ **Check Logs for Debugging**

```bash

cat  ~/gitlab_pr.log

```
